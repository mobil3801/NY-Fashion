# Comprehensive Production Rollback Strategy

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach to rolling back changes in our production environment, ensuring minimal disruption and data integrity.

## 2. Rollback Decision Criteria

### 2.1 Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Critical system errors
- Performance degradation > 30%
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity issues
- Significant user experience disruption

### 2.2 Rollback Decision Matrix
| Severity | Action | Approval Required |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Low | Optional Rollback | Team Lead |
| Medium | Recommended Rollback | CTO/Technical Director |
| High | Mandatory Immediate Rollback | CTO + Infrastructure Lead |

## 3. Rollback Procedures

### 3.1 Code Deployment Rollback

#### Preparation
- Maintain last known good version in version control
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy

#### Rollback Steps
1. Identify deployment version
2. Stop current deployment
3. Restore previous version
4. Verify system stability
5. Rollback database migrations if applicable

```bash
# Example rollback script
git checkout previous_stable_version
npm run deploy:previous
```

### 3.2 Database Rollback

#### Rollback Strategies
1. Point-in-Time Recovery
2. Snapshot Restoration
3. Transaction Rollback

#### Procedure
1. Stop all write operations
2. Create immediate backup
3. Restore from last known good backup
4. Replay transaction logs
5. Verify data consistency

```sql
-- Example database rollback
RESTORE DATABASE production 
FROM BACKUP 
WITH REPLACE, RECOVERY;
```

### 3.3 Configuration Rollback

#### Configuration Management
- Use version-controlled configuration management
- Implement configuration versioning
- Maintain configuration snapshots

#### Rollback Process
1. Identify last known good configuration
2. Revert to previous configuration
3. Restart affected services
4. Validate system behavior

```yaml
# Example configuration rollback
version: previous_version
settings:
  database_connection: previous_connection_string
```

### 3.4 System Failure Recovery

#### Failure Classification
- Partial System Failure
- Complete System Outage
- Data Corruption Scenario

#### Recovery Workflow
1. Isolate failure domain
2. Activate redundant systems
3. Restore from distributed backups
4. Perform integrity checks
5. Gradually restore services

## 4. Backup Procedures

### 4.1 Backup Types
- Daily Full Backup
- Hourly Incremental Backup
- Real-time Transaction Logs

### 4.2 Backup Locations
- Local Redundant Storage
- Cloud Backup (Multi-Region)
- Offline Cold Storage

## 5. Emergency Contacts

### Incident Response Team
1. Primary On-Call Engineer
   - Name: [Primary Engineer Name]
   - Phone: [Emergency Contact]
   - Email: [Work Email]

2. Secondary On-Call Engineer

## 6. Post-Rollback Verification

### Verification Checklist
- System Performance Metrics
- Error Log Analysis
- Data Integrity Validation
- User Experience Assessment

### Monitoring Tools
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Log Analysis Systems
- Real-time Error Tracking

## 7. Documentation and Reporting

### Incident Report Template
- Incident Description
- Root Cause Analysis
- Rollback Procedure Used
- Impact Assessment
- Preventive Recommendations

## 8. Training and Simulation

### Rollback Drill Frequency
- Quarterly Simulated Rollback Exercises
- Annual Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Test

## 9. Legal and Compliance

### Compliance Requirements
- Document all rollback procedures
- Maintain audit trails
- Ensure data privacy during recovery

## 10. Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
- Post-incident review
- Update rollback documentation
- Enhance automation scripts
